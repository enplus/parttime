        runs the bot in realtime for 60 seconds, waits 1 second between each execution, and
        write the tick data for playback in realtime. Increase the frequency if you
        are interested in larger-scale price movements rather than high-frequency trading.

        maxdepth is number of orders saved in each market. Idea being that we are unlikely
        to be interested in the order prices of anything beyond the 6th best

        what is the best way to stucture the data?
        ideally we would separate by market, then by bids/asks, then by each broker so it would be easy
        to find prices.
        but actually this would make the broker update mechanism kind of tough from the perspective of the
        actual trading bot. So we will implement it so that the exchange update tick goes as simply as possible
        namely we'll first separate by broker, then by market, then by bids/asks

        this can be quite a lot of data!
